        "This notebook shows the the process of using the [nystromformer](https://pypi.org/project/tf-watcher/) Python package. The self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token is a key component of the performance of Transformers. Nystromformer is a transformer variant that uses the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention with $O(n)$ complexity allowing to exhibit scalability as a function of sequence length.\n",
